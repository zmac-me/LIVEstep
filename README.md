# LIVEstep [![Build Status](https://api.cirrus-ci.com/github/probonopd/LIVEstep.svg)](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/furybsd/furybsd-livecd)

Live ISO based on FreeBSD with GNUstep and other components, made with https://github.com/jaronparsons/furybsd-livecd/. __This was experimental software to find out how viable GNUstep on FreeBSD is as a desktop in 2020.__ This work has conceptually gone into [helloSystem](https://hellosystem.github.io/docs/), a desktop system based on Qt.
